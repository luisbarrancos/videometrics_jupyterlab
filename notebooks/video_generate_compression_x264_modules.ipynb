Both content and video quality assessment are actives areas of research under several groups, including the VQEG or Video Quality Experts Group. We cannot cover all of this in-depth but we'll provide a brief assessment of the main families of techniques and the ones we'll be using in the tests that we'll be running.\n",

    " * Pixel Based Methods - try to quantify the image quality or degradation due to blurring, motion blur, other artifacts\n",
    " * Parametric or Bitstream Methods - these have access to encoding data, parameters, motion vectors and other related data and try to access the signal quality according to these. They're not accurate, but provide a good fast approximated indication.\n",
    " * Hybrid Methods - combine both the pixel based methods and the parametric or bitstream methods.\n",

    "Since we have access to the original source material and the compressed material we'll be generating, and performance is not critical, it makes sense to use full reference methods.\n",
    "Of these, the metrics we'll be using are:\n",
    "\n",
    " * PSNR - Peak Signal to Noise Ratio. Due to the characteristics of the HVS, PSNR is not a reliable indicator of perceived quality.\n",
    " * SSIM - Structural Similarity. SSIM measures perceived change in structural information, including luminance and contrast masking, it takes the HVS characteristics into consideration and is a more reliable indicator of perceived quality than PSNR.\n",
    " * VMAF - Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion, is a metric developed by NetFlix, composed of 4 distinct features which are fused via SVM or Suport Vector Machine, a type of supervised machine learning model used for data classification and regression analysis. These features are:\n",
    "   * VIF or Visual Information Fidelity, which considers information loss in 4 different spatial scales\n",
    "   * DLM or Detail Loss Metric, measures loss of details\n",
    "   * MCPD or Mean Co-located Pixel Difference, measures the temporal difference on the luminance component\n",
    "   * ANSNR or Anti-Noise Signal-to-Noise Ratio, abandoned in new VMAF versions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "We'll also be using AI/ML for perceptual video quality assessment methods with [LPIPS](https://richzhang.github.io/PerceptualSimilarity/) metric - Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity, and with the [Berkeley-Adobe Perceptual Patch Similarity (BAPPS) dataset](https://github.com/richzhang/PerceptualSimilarity#2-berkeley-adobe-perceptual-patch-similarity-bapps-dataset), as well as PSNR-HVS-M, that is, Peak Signal To Noise Ratio taking into account Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSV) and in-between coefficient contrast masking of DCT basis functions - a PSNR metric that takes into account the HVS response."
