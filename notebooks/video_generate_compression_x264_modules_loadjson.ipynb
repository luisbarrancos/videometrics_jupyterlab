    "\n",
    "Like with the creation of meaningful content for tests, the metrics used are and have been an area of active and ongoing research for quite some time. Both content and video quality assessment are actives areas of research under several groups, including the [VQEG or Video Quality Experts Group](https://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/vqeg/vqeg-home.aspx). We cannot cover all of this in-depth but we'll provide a brief assessment of the main families of techniques and the ones we'll be using in the tests that we'll be running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Succintly, there are **objective** and **subjective** quality models. Objective models can be measured free from human interpretation, and can be divided according to what signal we have available to test.\n",
    "Subjective models requires the viewers opinion of the quality of the video being watched and a mean score given.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full Reference Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "This method compares the encoded signal with a original reference signal and quantifies the difference according to specific metrics. Since they require both the original and the compressed signals, they cannot be used everywhere and since they measure pixel differences, there is heavy computational cost involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reduced Reference Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the [**Full Reference Method**](#Full-Reference-Method), except there's no access to the entire original signal, or due to constraints, it's impractical to acess it all.\n",
    "\n",
    "### No Reference Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Are used to assign a quality indication of the compressed signal without access to the original material. They are usually lighter to compute. \n",
    "These are divided into\n",
    " * **Pixel Based Methods** - try to quantify the image quality or degradation due to blurring, motion blur, other artifacts\n",
    " * **Parametric or Bitstream Methods** - these have access to encoding data, parameters, motion vectors and other related data and try to access the signal quality according to these. They're not accurate, but provide a good fast approximated indication.\n",
    " * **Hybrid Methods** - combine both the pixel based methods and the parametric or bitstream methods.\n",

    "### Video Quality Metrics Used\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have access to the original source material and the compressed material we'll be generating, and performance is not critical, it makes sense to use full reference methods.\n",
    "Of these, the metrics we'll be using are:\n",
    "\n",
    " * [**PSNR**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio) - Peak Signal to Noise Ratio. Due to the characteristics of the HVS, PSNR is not a reliable indicator of perceived quality.\n",
    " * [**SSIM**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity) - Structural Similarity. SSIM measures perceived change in structural information, including luminance and contrast masking, it takes the HVS characteristics into consideration and is a more reliable indicator of perceived quality than PSNR.\n",
    " * [**VMAF**](https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf) - Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion, is a metric developed by NetFlix, composed of 4 distinct features which are fused via SVM or Suport Vector Machine, a type of supervised machine learning model used for data classification and regression analysis. These features are:\n",
    "   * [**VIF**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_information_fidelity) or Visual Information Fidelity, which considers information loss in 4 different spatial scales\n",
    "   * DLM or Detail Loss Metric, measures loss of details\n",
    "   * MCPD or Mean Co-located Pixel Difference, measures the temporal difference on the luminance component\n",
    "   * ANSNR or Anti-Noise Signal-to-Noise Ratio, abandoned in new VMAF versions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "We'll also be using at a later stage AI/ML for perceptual video quality assessment methods with [LPIPS](https://richzhang.github.io/PerceptualSimilarity/) metric - Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity, and with the [Berkeley-Adobe Perceptual Patch Similarity (BAPPS) dataset](https://github.com/richzhang/PerceptualSimilarity#2-berkeley-adobe-perceptual-patch-similarity-bapps-dataset), albeit in a randomized set of static frames, as well as PSNR-HVS-M, that is, Peak Signal To Noise Ratio taking into account Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSV) and in-between coefficient contrast masking of DCT basis functions - a PSNR metric that takes into account the HVS response."

    "[Structured Similarity Index Matrix](https://www.imatest.com/docs/ssim/) and [Multi-Scale Structural SIMilarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity#Multi-component_SSIM) (source code [here](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~z70wang/research/iwssim/)) is one of the most well-known image quality evaluation algorithms and computes relative quality scores between the reference and distorted images by comparing details across resolutions, providing high performance for learning-based image codecs. The MS-SSIM is more flexible than single-scale methods such as SSIM by including variations of image resolution and viewing conditions. Also, the MS-SSIM metric introduces an image synthesis-based approach to calibrate the parameters that weight the relative importance between different scales. A high score expresses better image quality.\n",

    "[Peak Signal to Noise Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio).\n",
    "Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio is widely used as a video quality metric or performance indicator. Some studies have indicated that it [correlates poorly](https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=143055) with subjective quality, whilst others have used it on the basis that it provides a good correlation with subjective data.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Visual Information Fidelity (source code [here](https://github.com/pavancm/Visual-Information-Fidelity---Python)) measures the loss of human perceived information in some degradation process, e.g. image compression. VIF exploits the natural scene statistics to evaluate information fidelity and is related to the Shannon mutual information between the degraded and original pristine image. The VIF metric operates in the wavelet domain and many experiments found that the metric values agree well with the human response, which also occurs for learning-based image codecs. A high score expresses better image quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **VMAF**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion metric and score, developed by Netflix is focused on artifacts created by compression and rescaling and estimates the quality score by computing scores from several quality assessment algorithms and fusing them with a support vector machine (SVM). Even if this metric is specific for videos, it can also be used to evaluate the quality of single images and has been proved that performs reasonably well for learning-based image codecs. Since the metric takes as input raw images in the YUV color space format, the PNG (RGB color space) images are converted to the YUV 4:4:4 format using FFMPEG (BT.709 primaries). A higher score of this metric indicates better image quality.\n",

    "Since we had a constant quality rate factor for this test, so instead of using a fixed value quantization matrix we allow it to vary as long as it is bounded by the crf value, for the given CRF value, compression was more efficient and retained more details compared with the original on the second half of the clip.\n",

    "Another observation is that the the V channel had the same fluctuations but in general had much lower SSIM values than the U channel which was consistently above the V channel SSIM value. Noteworthy is also the more subdued impact of the adaptive quantization of the CRF mode on the U channel, since its variation is much less than the Y and V channel - around 0.005 standard deviations from the mean, compared with the V channel approx. 0.009."

Multi-scale SSIM might also sched some light, as well as the other objective non-perceptual metrics."
